        "\n",
        "In this challenge, we desire to predict the short-term evolution of the stock market prices of five major companies. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_prediction), **stock market prediction** is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "> [...] the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Needless to say, the potential returns for a successful approach in this direction is of great interest for financial analysts and traders. However, there is an on-going mathematical and philosophical debate on [whether it is even possible to predict anything about the future evolution of stocks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk_hypothesis), beyond pure guessing:\n",
        "\n",
        "> The efficient-market hypothesis suggests that stock prices reflect all currently available information and any price changes that are not based on newly revealed information thus are inherently unpredictable. Others disagree and those with this viewpoint possess myriad methods and technologies which purportedly allow them to gain future price information.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the truth might be somewhere in the middle, we'd like to do our best to analyse and predict future evolutions of the stock market."
