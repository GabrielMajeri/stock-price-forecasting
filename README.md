# Stock price forecasting using machine learning

This repository contains [our](#authors) entry to the "Quant World" challenge organized by LSEG Romania in 2022.

The objective was to predict the short-term evolution of the closing price for five different stocks, using historical data from about 2012. Since the input dataset contained no other information about the companies except for opening/closing prices and trading volumes, we had to rely on [technical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis) to predict future changes in the stocks' values.
